# Scope Statement for Personal Financial Management System Project
**Title**: Personal Financial Management System

### Project Objective
To develop a personal financial management application that tracks income, expenses, and bills. Should generate financial summaries and provide basic reporting features. The project will be completed using Python and SQLite, following SDLC phases (feasibility, analysis, design, implementation, testing).

### Project Deliverables
1. **Feasibility Study (Weeks 1-4)**:
    * Scope statement outlining core features (like transaction tracking and bill management).
    * Technical feasibility analysis (Python and SQLite).
    * Gantt chart for task scheduling.
2. **Design (Weeks 4-7)**:
    * Likely an ER diagram for the SQLite database (tables likely to include Transactions and Bills).
    * Prototype (basic GUI or CLI mockup).
3. **Implementation (Weeks 8-12)**:
    * Core features:
        * Add/edit/delete income and expenses.
        * Schedule recurring bills and mark them as paid.
        * Generate monthly summaries (income vs. expenses).
4. **Testing (Weeks 13-14)**:
    * Unit tests (validate transaction inputs).
    * UAT with myself and my professor as the stakeholders.
5. **Deployment & Documentation (Weeks 15-16)**:
    * Final application with user-friendly interface.
    * Documentation:
        * User manual.
        * Technical documentation.

### Project Exclusions
* Advanced features like investment tracking, tax calculations, or budgeting tools.
* Cloud synchronization, mobile app development, and web development.
* Multi-user support or authentication.

### Assumptions
* I'm capable of using Python, SQLite, and necessary libraries (probably Tkinter for GUI).
* Financial data will be manually entered (no APIs).
* Testing will be conducted by me.

### Constraints
* Limited development time (4 months).
* No budget for paid tools or services (using free/open-source tools only).
* Balancing coursework deadlines, work, and other classes with project milestones.

### Stakeholders
* **Primary Stakeholder**: Me, myself, and I (end-user and developer).
* **Secondary Stakeholder**: Professor Clayton (for grading/feedback).

### Success Criteria
* A functional application that meets core requirements (track income/expenses, manage bills, generate reports).
* All deliverables (prototype, diagrams, code, documentation) submitted via GitHub and Blackboard.
* Positive feedback from UAT (app should be usable and error-free for personal needs).
